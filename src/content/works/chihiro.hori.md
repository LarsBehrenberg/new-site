  ## Background

  Being a freelance translater and interpreter, Chihiro Hori was looking for something that would not only provide information about her work, but also communicate a feel of professionality and accessibility to her clients.

  The client visiting her website would need to be able to easily understand what is it that she does and then be only a click away to reach out to her.

  This was the idea we started to design the website with.

  ## Process

  Looking at Chihiro Hori's field of work, we decided on a calm and ensuring bronze color scheme with gradients for buttons, boxes and background images. From here we went on to design the logo. Because Chihiro Hori does not only represent translation work, but is also active as a health advisor, her logo needed to represent a balance between the two.

  After going trough different ideas, we settled on a vegetable-shaped pen. Looking at the overall colors in the website, we wanted the logo to stick out and catch the visitor attention. We decided for on a red accent color.

  Illustrations with a darker bronze colors kept the overall color scheme and made for a ensuring atmosphere.

  ## Result

  Having layed out the fundamentals of the website, we decided that instead of having several subpages, we wanted a single concise page with sections for each menu point. The sections have background animations that communicate her work also visually in addition to the text.

  Throughout each section of the page, the visitor is able to reach out for bookings, information and more.
