# I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. You hate me; you want to kill me! **Well, go on!** _Kill me!_ KILL ME!

## You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

1. You hit me with a cricket bat.
2. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.
3. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.

### You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

Saving the world with meals on wheels. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

- You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
- The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.
- Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.

All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!

They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. _catches himself_ And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

Saving the world with meals on wheels. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You've swallowed a planet! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. _catches himself_ And that is not how I'm introducing myself. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.

You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.
